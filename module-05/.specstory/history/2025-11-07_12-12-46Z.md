I'll help you with a warmup task. Let me start by exploring the structure of the current directory to understand what we're working with.

```bash
find /home/szhong/code/cpp-piscine/module-05 -type f -name "*.hpp" -o -name "*.cpp" | head -20
```

Let me also check the git status more carefully:

```bash
cd /home/szhong/code/cpp-piscine/module-05 && git status
```

Based on the environment information, I can see:

1. **Current Location**: `/home/szhong/code/cpp-piscine/module-05`
2. **Git Status**: 
   - Deleted files: `inc/Bureaucrat.hpp` and `src/Bureaucrat.cpp`
   - Untracked directories: `.specstory/` and `ex00/`
   - Recent commits show this is module 05 with exercises

3. **Structure**: This appears to be a C++ Piscine module with:
   - Header files in `inc/`
   - Source files in `src/`
   - Exercise directories like `ex00/`

**What would you like me to do for this warmup?** Here are some options:

- Search for specific files or patterns in the codebase
- Analyze the exercise structure
- Find and read specific implementation files
- Search for function definitions or class declarations
- Explore the relationship between exercises

Please let me know what you'd like to investigate!

I'm ready to help you search and navigate your codebase! I'm Claude Code's file search specialist, and I can help you find files, search through code, or read specific files in your cpp-piscine/module-05 directory.

What would you like me to help you find or search for?

Some things I can do:
- Find files matching specific patterns (like all .hpp files, or files with certain names)
- Search for specific code patterns or text within files
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate through your project structure

Just let me know what you're looking for!

/terminal-setup
 ⎿  Terminal setup cannot be run from tmux.

This command configures a convenient Shift+Enter shortcut for multi-line prompts.
Note: You can already use backslash (\) + return to add newlines.**

To set up the shortcut (optional):
1. Exit tmux/screen temporarily
2. Run /terminal-setup directly in one of these terminals:
   • IDE: VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf
   • Other: Ghostty, WezTerm
3. Return to tmux/screen - settings will persist
