I'll help you warm up by exploring the current state of the module-05 directory. Let me start by understanding the structure and recent changes.
<function_calls>
<invoke name="bash">
<parameter name="command">find /home/szhong/code/cpp-piscine/module-05 -type f -name "*.hpp" -o -name "*.cpp" | head -20</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>
<function_calls>
<invoke name="bash">
<parameter name="command">ls -la /home/szhong/code/cpp-piscine/module-05/</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>
<function_calls>
<invoke name="bash">
<parameter name="command">tree /home/szhong/code/cpp-piscine/module-05/ -L 2</parameter>
</invoke>
</function_calls>

Here's what I found in the module-05 directory:

**Current Structure:**
- The repository shows deleted files: `inc/Bureaucrat.hpp` and `src/Bureaucrat.cpp` (marked with D)
- New directory: `ex00/` (untracked, marked with ??)
- Recent commit: "feat: exercise00" suggests ex00 was just added

**Recent Git History:**
1. 508c310 - feat: exercise00
2. f70ff1e - feat: added module 05
3. 091f48d - chore: added all subject files
4. 2708f4b - chore: added header to files in module 4
5. ca7bece - chore: added header to files in module 03

**What this tells us:**
It appears you're working on Module 05 of a C++ Piscine (42 school curriculum), which typically covers exceptions and error handling. The deletion of the root-level Bureaucrat files and creation of ex00/ suggests you're organizing exercises into separate directories.

Would you like me to:
1. Explore the contents of the ex00/ directory?
2. Look at the git diff to see what was changed?
3. Search for specific files or patterns in the module?
4. Analyze the code structure for potential issues?

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) (sidechain)**_

I'm ready to help you search and explore the codebase! 

Looking at the environment, I can see we're in a C++ project (`cpp-piscine/module-05`) with some recent activity around exercise00 and Bureaucrat classes.

What would you like me to find or search for? I can help you:
- Locate specific files or file patterns
- Search for code patterns or text within files
- Read and analyze file contents
- Explore the project structure

Just let me know what you need!

_**User**_

yesterday I installed /home/szhong/Downloads/SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64 in order to work with my prompt skills and work with claude code. so please help me to make it more accessible from anywhere when I use terminal. this is a school computer so I don't have the sudo access but I want you to help me manage it.

---

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

I'll help you make SpecStoryCLI accessible from anywhere in your terminal without needing sudo access. Let me first check your current setup and then add it to your user PATH.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check if the file exists and is executable

`ls -la /home/szhong/Downloads/SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check current PATH directories

`echo $PATH`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check if local bin directory exists

`ls -la ~/.local/bin 2>/dev/null || echo "Directory does not exist"`

Result:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Perfect! I can see that:
1. The executable is located at `/home/szhong/Downloads/SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64/specstory` and is already executable
2. `~/.local/bin` is already in your PATH (appears multiple times actually)
3. You already have symlinks for other tools like `claude` and `kitty` in `~/.local/bin`

I'll create a symlink to make SpecStoryCLI accessible from anywhere:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Create symlink in local bin directory

`ln -s /home/szhong/Downloads/SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64/specstory ~/.local/bin/specstory`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Verify specstory is now accessible

`which specstory`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Test if specstory command works

`specstory --version 2>&1 || specstory --help 2>&1 | head -5`

Result:

```
/home/szhong/.local/bin/specstory
```

Result:

```
0.13.0 (SpecStory)
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Excellent! SpecStoryCLI is now accessible from anywhere. Here's what I did:

✅ Created a symbolic link from `~/.local/bin/specstory` → `/home/szhong/Downloads/SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64/specstory`

Now you can simply type `specstory` from any directory in your terminal, and it will work. The version shows as **0.13.0**.

Since `~/.local/bin` is already in your PATH, this change takes effect immediately - no need to restart your terminal or source any files.

You can now use SpecStoryCLI with Claude Code to work on your prompt skills from anywhere on your system!

_**User**_

also I don't like to put the executable folder inside Downloads. Please help me move into more sensible places

---

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Good idea! Let's move it to a more appropriate location. I'll move it to `~/.local/share/` which is a standard location for user-specific application data, similar to where your Claude installation is located.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check what's in .local/share directory

`ls -la ~/.local/share/ | head -20`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Move SpecStoryCLI to .local/share

`mv /home/szhong/Downloads/SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64 ~/.local/share/specstory`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Verify the move was successful

`ls -la ~/.local/share/specstory`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Update symlink to new location

`ln -sf ~/.local/share/specstory/specstory ~/.local/bin/specstory`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Test that specstory still works

`specstory --version`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Perfect! ✅ Successfully moved and configured. Here's what I did:

1. **Moved** `/home/szhong/Downloads/SpecStoryCLI_Linux_x86_64` → `~/.local/share/specstory`
2. **Updated** the symlink in `~/.local/bin/specstory` to point to the new location
3. **Verified** it still works (version 0.13.0)

Now SpecStoryCLI is in a much more sensible location:
- **Installation**: `~/.local/share/specstory/` (alongside your other apps like Claude)
- **Executable**: `~/.local/bin/specstory` (accessible from anywhere)
- **Config data**: `~/.local/share/specstory/.specstory/` (kept in the same directory)

This follows standard Linux conventions for user-installed applications, and it's out of your Downloads folder where it belongs!

_**User**_

is it possible to make it accessible inside the GNOE so I can click it?

---

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Yes! I can create a desktop entry for GNOME so you can launch SpecStoryCLI from the applications menu. Let me create a `.desktop` file for you.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check existing desktop entries

`ls -la ~/.local/share/applications/`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check SpecStoryCLI help to understand usage

SpecStory is a wrapper for terminal coding agents that auto-saves markdown files of all your chat interactions.       
         
  USAGE  
         
    specstory [command] [--flags]                                                           
            
  EXAMPLES  
            
    # Check terminal coding agents installation                                             
    specstory check                                                                         
                                                                                            
    # Run the default agent with auto-saving                                                
    specstory run

    specstory run claude                                                                    
    specstory run codex                                                                     
    specstory run cursor
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Now let me check the kitty.desktop file to see the format, then create a similar one for SpecStoryCLI:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Read** `/home/szhong/.local/share/applications/kitty.desktop`

Result:

```

```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Now I'll create a desktop entry for SpecStoryCLI. Since it's a terminal wrapper, it should launch in a terminal:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Write**

```desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=SpecStory
GenericName=Terminal Coding Agent Wrapper
Comment=Auto-saves markdown files of all your chat interactions with coding agents
TryExec=/home/szhong/.local/bin/specstory
Exec=/home/szhong/.local/bin/specstory run
Icon=utilities-terminal
Categories=Development;Utility;
Terminal=true
Keywords=coding;ai;claude;terminal;

```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Make desktop entry executable

`chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/specstory.desktop`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Update desktop database

`update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/ 2>&1 || echo "Database update may require manual refresh"`

Result:

```
File created successfully at: /home/szhong/.local/share/applications/specstory.desktop
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Perfect! ✅ I've created a desktop entry for SpecStoryCLI. Here's what you need to know:

**What I created:**
- Desktop file at `~/.local/share/applications/specstory.desktop`
- It will launch `specstory run` (the default agent) in a terminal window
- Uses a standard terminal icon (since SpecStoryCLI doesn't come with its own icon)

**How to access it:**
1. Press the **Super key** (Windows key) to open the Activities overview
2. Type **"SpecStory"** or **"spec"**
3. Click on the SpecStory icon to launch it

**Note:** You may need to:
- Wait a few seconds for GNOME to index the new application
- Log out and back in if it doesn't appear immediately
- Or press `Alt+F2`, type `r`, and press Enter to restart GNOME Shell (on X11)

The application will open in a terminal window and run `specstory run` automatically, allowing you to work with your coding agents and have all interactions auto-saved!

_**User**_

is it possible to change the logo?

---

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Yes! Let me help you find or set a custom icon for SpecStoryCLI. First, let me check if SpecStoryCLI came with any icon files:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Search for any icon files in SpecStoryCLI directory

`find ~/.local/share/specstory -type f \( -name "*.png" -o -name "*.svg" -o -name "*.ico" -o -name "*.jpg" \) 2>/dev/null`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check what's in the .specstory config directory

`ls -la ~/.local/share/specstory/.specstory/`

Result:

```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

It looks like SpecStoryCLI doesn't come with an icon. You have a few options:

**Option 1: Use a system icon**
I can change it to use a different system icon. Here are some good options:
- `text-editor` - document/editor icon
- `applications-development` - development tools icon
- `dialog-scripts` - script icon
- `emblem-documents` - document emblem

**Option 2: Download/create a custom icon**
You can provide your own PNG or SVG file, and I'll set it up.

**Option 3: Use an emoji/text-based icon**
Some desktop environments support emoji icons.

Which would you prefer? If you want a system icon, which one sounds good? Or if you have a custom icon file (or want me to help you find one), let me know!

For now, let me show you what system icons are available:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check available system icons related to development

`ls /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/ 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(text|edit|develop|script|terminal)" | head -15`

Error:

```
The user doesn't want to proceed with this tool use. The tool use was rejected (eg. if it was a file edit, the new_string was NOT written to the file). STOP what you are doing and wait for the user to tell you how to proceed.
